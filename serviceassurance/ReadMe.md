# AI Assisted Service Assurance Insights/Predictions

## Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a service assurance insights (net promoter score -NPS- for business growth predicted based on performance of the telco service metrics) model using a Transformer Neural Network. The model is trained on semi-synthetic (encorporated real FCC Open Data and correlated with real weather open data sources) telecom  network stack data to predict network performance metrics and predict NPS. The goal is to provide business vs network performance correlation for planned growth.

## Data

The dataset is saved in a compressed CSV file: `data/telecom_sevass_data.csv.xz`. This data set is correlated child of following two real world datasets and feature engineered for the remaining ones: <br>
[>>FCC Customer Complaints Data Set](https://opendata.fcc.gov/Consumer/CGB-Consumer-Complaints-Data/3xyp-aqkj/about_data)<br>
[>>OpenWeather Data Set](https://openweathermap.org/)<br>

## Model

The model is based on a Transformer neural network (175K parms), which is well-suited for sequential data. The architecture includes:
- Embedding layer to convert input sequences.
- Transformer blocks with multi-head attention.
- Fully connected layers for regression output.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training

The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting. The dataset is split into training and validation sets with an 80-20 split.

### Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which provides an accuracy-like metric for regression problems. The evaluation metric gives insights into the model's prediction error as a percentage.

## Results

The model predictions are compared against actual values for key metrics like latency. The MAPE value is calculated and printed, providing a quantitative measure of the model's performance.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the application of Transformer neural networks for predicting network performance metrics in a telecom environment. The use of synthetic data and the evaluation of the model using MAPE provide a comprehensive approach to service assurance insights.
