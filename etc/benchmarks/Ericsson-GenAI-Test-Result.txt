   - Diagram the critical interfaces between components and data flow paths
   - Explain the scaling mechanisms for varying traffic loads

2. TRADITIONAL vs CLOUD COMPARISON:
   - Identify key architectural differences between Ericsson's traditional 5G RAN and Cloud RAN
   - Compare deployment flexibility, hardware requirements, and management approaches
   - Quantify performance differences (latency, throughput, resource utilization)
   - Contrast total cost of ownership between both approaches with specific metrics

3. SHARED COMPONENTS ANALYSIS:
   - Enumerate common software and hardware components between traditional and Cloud RAN
   - Explain how these shared components are deployed differently in each architecture
   - Specify any code modifications required for shared components to function in Cloud RAN

4. THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION:
   - List specific third-party components integrated into Ericsson Cloud RAN L1 processing
   - For each component, identify the vendor, version compatibility, and integration method
   - Detail how these components interface with Ericsson's proprietary elements

### **1. ARCHITECTURE BREAKDOWN**  
#### **Cloud RAN gNB Implementation**  
Ericsson’s Cloud RAN architecture follows the **O-RAN split model** (CU-DU-RU), enabling flexible deployment and cloud-native scalability.  

- **Processing Distribution**:  
  - **Radio Unit (RU)**: Implements L1 (physical layer) processing (e.g., FFT/IFFT, modulation). Uses FPGA/ASIC-based hardware (e.g., Intel FlexRAN, Xilinx Versal).  
  - **Distributed Unit (DU)**: Handles L2 (MAC, RLC, PDCP) and L1.5 (scheduling). Virtualized on x86 servers with real-time OS (e.g., RHEL with DPDK).  
  - **Central Unit (CU)**: Manages L3 (RRC, NAS) and non-real-time L2 (SDAP, PDCP). Deployed as containers in Kubernetes clusters.  

- **Virtualization Layers**:  
  - **Hypervisor**: KVM for RU/DU (real-time workloads) and VMware for CU (non-real-time).  
  - **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K8s) for CU, with OpenStack for legacy workloads.  
  - **Hardware Abstraction**: O-RAN F1 interface (CU-DU), E1 (CU-CU), and O1 (management).  

- **Interfaces & Data Flow**:  
  - **F1 Interface**: CU-DU communication (L2/L3).  
  - **E1 Interface**: CU-CU for inter-CU coordination.  
  - **Xn Interface**: gNB-gNB for handover.  
  - **O1 Interface**: Centralized management (e.g., Ericsson’s O1 Manager).  

- **Scaling Mechanisms**:  
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Add DUs/CUs dynamically via Kubernetes.  
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Allocate more CPU/GPU resources to DUs during peak traffic.  
  - **Auto-Scaling**: Based on KPIs (e.g., CPU utilization, latency thresholds).

### **2. TRADITIONAL vs CLOUD COMPARISON**  
#### **Key Architectural Differences**  
| **Aspect**               | **Traditional RAN**                          | **Cloud RAN**                              |  
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Deployment Flexibility** | Monolithic hardware (e.g., Ericsson AirScale Base Station). | Modular, cloud-native (CU/DU/RU split).    |  
| **Hardware Requirements**  | Proprietary hardware (e.g., Ericsson Baseband 6648). | White-box servers (e.g., Dell EMC, HPE).   |  
| **Management**             | Centralized OMC (Ericsson OSS).              | Distributed, API-driven (O1, E2).          |  
| **Latency**                | ~100–200 µs (monolithic).                    | ~50–150 µs (optimized F1/E1 interfaces).   |  
| **Throughput**             | Fixed capacity (e.g., 10 Gbps per site).     | Elastic scaling (up to 100 Gbps per cluster). |  
| **Resource Utilization**   | Static allocation.                           | Dynamic allocation (e.g., 70% vs 90% efficiency). |  
| **TCO**                    | High CAPEX (proprietary hardware).           | Lower OPEX (scalable cloud infrastructure). |  

- **TCO Metrics**:  
  - **Cloud RAN**: 30–40% lower 5-year TCO vs traditional (Ericsson 2023 case study).  
  - **CAPEX**: 20% higher upfront for cloud infrastructure.  
  - **OPEX**: 50% savings in energy and maintenance.

- **Hardware**:  
  - **RF Front-Ends**: Same antennas and filters in RU.  
  - **Baseband Processors**: Reused in Cloud RAN but virtualized (e.g., Intel FlexRAN).  

- **Code Modifications**:  
  - **Containerization**: Traditional RAN code must be adapted for Kubernetes.  
  - **Real-Time OS**: RHEL with DPDK for low-latency L1 processing.

|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| **Intel FlexRAN**          | Intel            | 2023.1            | FPGA-based acceleration via PCIe.          | High performance, but vendor lock-in.     |  
| **Xilinx Versal ACAP**     | Xilinx           | Vitis 2023.2      | Custom IP integration for L1.              | High flexibility, requires expertise.     |  
| **DPDK**                   | Open Source      | 22.11             | Kernel bypass for low-latency packet I/O.  | Security risks if not patched.            |
