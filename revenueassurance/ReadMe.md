# Revenue Assurance and Fraud Management (RAFM) with AI Assistance

## Project Overview

This project aims to deliver an RAFM prediction (if that particular telco transaction is fraudulent or not) with an AI model assistance with various options: <br>

(1) Balanced Random Forest Model<br>
(2) Transformer Neural Network Model<br>

The models are trained on synthetic telecom data to predict fraud cases and identify potential anomalies. The goal is to provide proactive revenue management and enhance revenue workflows.<br>

Data-Set: https://huggingface.co/datasets/fenar/revenue_assurance

## Options 

(1) Revenue Assurance is a domain where traditional machine learning models, such as tree-based methods, often perform very well. Specifically, models like the `Balanced Random Forest` (01-xxx Worx) can be advantageous due to their inherent ability to handle class imbalance and interpretability.<br>[ Test Accuracy: 0.99962] <br>

(2) We gave a chance for a `Transformer-NN` (02-xxx Worx) model with the same dataset, but it has not been a super dope experience, as such models need much more data to capture complex patterns and interactions and also require significantly more computational power and time for training. <br> [ Test Accuracy: 0.999325] <br>

The winner (So Far) is `Balanced Random Forest1 with the data we have for training/fine-tuning.<br>

## Data

## Steps to Run

(1) (Obviously) Clone the Repo :-)  <br>
(2) Open revenueassurance/01-telco-revass-randomforest.ipynb and Run-All. This would install all required libs, extract data from data/telecom_revass_data.csv.xz and load it for the model training {BalancedRandomForestClassifier }, evaluate it and save it under models/ directory. <br>
(3) Run 01-model_server.py which loads the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and serves on http://localhost:5000/predict url. <br>

(4) From a cli , do a curl query: <br>

## Steps to Test
(A) Potential Fraud Test: <br>
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "Call_Duration": 300,
    "Data_Usage": 10000,
    "Sms_Count": 50,
    "Roaming_Indicator": 1,
    "MobileWallet_Use": 1,
    "Plan_Type_prepaid": 1,
    "Plan_Type_postpaid": 0,
    "Cost": 500,
    "Cellular_Location_Distance": 100,
    "Personal_Pin_Used": 0, 
    "Avg_Call_Duration": 50,
    "Avg_Data_Usage": 8000
}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```
(B) Potential Non-Fraud Test: <br>
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "Call_Duration": 10,
    "Data_Usage": 300,
    "Sms_Count": 5,
    "Roaming_Indicator": 0,
    "MobileWallet_Use": 1,
    "Plan_Type_prepaid": 1,
    "Plan_Type_postpaid": 0,
    "Cost": 50,
    "Cellular_Location_Distance": 3,
    "Personal_Pin_Used": 1,
    "Avg_Call_Duration": 12,
    "Avg_Data_Usage": 350
}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```
## Deploying as k8s pod 

Add model.pkl to Docker folder -> Then you would have all the required files to build a image for model server. <br>
