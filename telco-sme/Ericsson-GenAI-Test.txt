I need a comprehensive technical analysis of Ericsson's Cloud RAN architecture compared to their traditional deployment model. Please address each section sequentially:

1. ARCHITECTURE BREAKDOWN:
   - Detail the complete system architecture of Ericsson's Cloud RAN gNB implementation
   - Include processing distribution across CU, DU, and RU components
   - Specify the virtualization layers, container orchestration, and hardware abstraction methods
   - Diagram the critical interfaces between components and data flow paths
   - Explain the scaling mechanisms for varying traffic loads

2. TRADITIONAL vs CLOUD COMPARISON:
   - Identify key architectural differences between Ericsson's traditional 5G RAN and Cloud RAN
   - Compare deployment flexibility, hardware requirements, and management approaches
   - Quantify performance differences (latency, throughput, resource utilization)
   - Contrast total cost of ownership between both approaches with specific metrics

3. SHARED COMPONENTS ANALYSIS:
   - Enumerate common software and hardware components between traditional and Cloud RAN
   - Explain how these shared components are deployed differently in each architecture
   - Specify any code modifications required for shared components to function in Cloud RAN

4. THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION:
   - List specific third-party components integrated into Ericsson Cloud RAN L1 processing
   - For each component, identify the vendor, version compatibility, and integration method
   - Detail how these components interface with Ericsson's proprietary elements
   - Evaluate any performance or security implications of these third-party dependencies

5. RHEL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Identify specific Red Hat Enterprise Linux components utilized in Ericsson's 5G radio software stack
   - Explain how these components are hardened for telecommunications requirements
   - Detail any special configurations necessary for real-time processing capabilities
   - List specific RHEL versions certified for Ericsson Cloud RAN deployment

Please provide concrete examples, performance metrics, and reference implementations where possible. For proprietary information, specify what's publicly available versus what requires vendor engagement.
