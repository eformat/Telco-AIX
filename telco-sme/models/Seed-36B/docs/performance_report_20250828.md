### Test Scenarios Results

| Query | Standard (tokens/s) | High-Performance (tokens/s) | Improvement |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| 5G Network Slicing | 18.4 | 20.0 | +8.7% |
| Edge Computing Benefits | 19.9 | 19.9 | +0.0% |
| Network Troubleshooting | 18.4 | 19.9 | +8.2% |

### Performance Metrics Detail

**Standard Deployment:**
- Best performance: 19.94 tokens/s (5.02s)
- Worst performance: 18.42 tokens/s (5.43s)
- Variance: 0.89 tokens/s

**High-Performance Deployment:**
- Best performance: 19.96 tokens/s (5.01s)
- Worst performance: 19.93 tokens/s (5.02s)  
- Variance: 0.03 tokens/s (97% more consistent)

## Technical Observations

### Response Quality
Both deployments generated comparable response quality and length:
- Standard: 392-488 characters per response
- High-Performance: 403-485 characters per response

### Resource Utilization
Based on configuration differences:
- **Standard**: More conservative resource usage, suitable for sustained workloads
- **High-Performance**: Higher GPU utilization (95% vs 90%), better for peak performance

## Recommendations

### When to Use Standard Deployment
- **Regular customer service queries** (< 16K context needed)
- **Cost-sensitive workloads** (lower resource consumption)
- **Sustained high-volume operations** (90% GPU utilization provides headroom)

### When to Use High-Performance Deployment  
- **Complex technical queries** requiring longer context (up to 32K tokens)
- **Batch processing** scenarios requiring maximum throughput
- **Time-sensitive applications** where consistency matters
- **Peak demand periods** where maximum performance is needed

### Load Balancing Strategy
Consider intelligent routing based on:
1. **Query complexity**: Route simple queries to standard, complex to high-performance
2. **Context length**: Queries > 8K tokens to high-performance deployment
3. **Time sensitivity**: Critical queries to high-performance for better consistency

### Active Deployments ✅
- **Standard deployment**: Healthy, 18.9 tokens/s average
- **High-performance deployment**: Healthy, 19.9 tokens/s average  
- **Shared API key**: Working for both endpoints
- **SSL endpoints**: Accessible via OpenShift routes

## Next Steps

1. **Extended Testing**: Run longer performance tests with larger token counts
2. **Load Testing**: Test concurrent request handling capabilities
3. **Context Window Testing**: Verify 32K context performance advantage
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Track GPU utilization patterns over time
5. **vLLM Metrics Integration**: Implement Prometheus metrics collection

## Technical Notes

- SSL warnings suppressed for OpenShift self-signed certificates (normal)
- Tests used 100 token limit for consistent comparison
- Telecom-specific queries ensured realistic workload simulation  
- Both deployments running on same RTX PRO 6000 96GB GPU hardware
