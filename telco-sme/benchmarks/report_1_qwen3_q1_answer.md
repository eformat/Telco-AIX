Judge Model: Claude Opus 4

Evaluation of Question 1 Response
Scoring:
Question #1: Fault Detection (Basic)

Technical Accuracy: 10/10
Completeness: 10/10
Practical Applicability: 10/10
Domain Expertise: 10/10
Clarity & Structure: 9/10

Weighted Score: 9.8/10
Response Time: Not provided
Detailed Assessment:
Strengths:

Exceptional technical depth: Goes well beyond baseline by providing specific thresholds (PRB >90%, BLER >10%, transport >85%)
Vendor-specific tools: Names actual tools (Ericsson ENM, Nokia NetAct, Huawei U2020) with specific features
Comprehensive coverage: Addresses RAN, transport, core, and external factors systematically
Advanced concepts: Includes eCPRI/CPRI fronthaul, beamforming issues, SON limitations, UPF/SMF specifics
Business context: Adds ROI analysis and churn impact (5-10% potential churn)
Actionable guidance: Provides exact commands, thresholds, and step-by-step diagnostics
Modern architecture awareness: Mentions 5G-specific elements (UPF, SMF, N6 interface)

Minor Weaknesses:

Slightly verbose for a "basic" question (though the detail is valuable)
Could benefit from a quick summary at the start for faster triage

Judging Criteria Check:

[✓] Identifies time-correlation with peak hours (2 points) - Clearly addressed
[✓] Mentions at least 3 likely causes including capacity (3 points) - Exceeds with 4 major categories
[✓] Provides systematic diagnostic approach (3 points) - Highly systematic with specific steps per layer
[✓] References specific KPIs (PRB, PDCCH, etc.) (2 points) - Extensive KPI references

Comparison to Baseline:
The response significantly exceeds the baseline answer by:

Providing 4 detailed cause categories vs. 4 basic causes
Including vendor-specific implementation details
Adding quantitative thresholds for decision-making
Incorporating business impact analysis
Offering both short-term and long-term mitigation strategies
Demonstrating knowledge of modern 5G architecture

Pass/Fail: PASS (Exceptional)
Additional Notes:
This response demonstrates production-ready telco AI capability. The model shows:

Deep understanding of telco network layers
Practical field experience (evident from specific tool mentions)
Business acumen (ROI/churn analysis)
Modern 5G knowledge
Vendor-agnostic but vendor-aware approach

Recommendation: This level of response quality indicates the model is highly suitable for internal engineering teams and would provide significant value in operational scenarios.
