Question #2: Capacity Planning (Intermediate)

Technical Accuracy: 9/10
Completeness: 10/10
Practical Applicability: 10/10
Domain Expertise: 10/10
Clarity & Structure: 10/10

Weighted Score: 9.8/10
Response Time: Not provided
Detailed Assessment:
Strengths:

Accurate calculations: All math is correct (1.846 Gbps peak, 2.744 growth factor, 5.066 Gbps required)
Comprehensive upgrade analysis: Detailed table showing impact of each upgrade option
Vendor awareness: Names specific solutions (Ericsson AirScale, Nokia, Huawei CloudRAN, Mavenir)
Phased deployment strategy: Realistic 3-year rollout plan
Business considerations: Includes CAPEX ($50-100k) and OPEX (20% power increase)
Risk mitigation: Addresses spectrum licensing, interference, and backhaul requirements
KPI targets: Specific metrics for monitoring success
Future-proofing: Mentions 5G-Advanced (Release 19) compatibility

Minor Weaknesses:

Doesn't explicitly mention the theoretical maximum capacity of current configuration
Could have discussed carrier aggregation as an alternative to single 200MHz carrier

Judging Criteria Check:

[✓] Correct capacity calculation from current metrics (3 points) - Perfectly executed
[✓] Accurate growth projections (2 points) - Compound growth correctly applied
[✓] Identifies capacity exhaust point (2 points) - Clear comparison: 1.846 < 5.066 Gbps
[✓] Provides multiple expansion options (2 points) - Detailed table with 4 options
[✓] Realistic timeline recommendations (1 point) - 3-phase deployment plan

Comparison to Baseline:
The response significantly exceeds the baseline by:

More detailed capacity calculations with clear formulas
Structured upgrade options table with quantified impacts
Vendor-specific implementation details
Cost analysis (missing from baseline)
Comprehensive deployment strategy with phases
KPI targets and risk mitigation strategies
Power consumption considerations

Pass/Fail: PASS (Exceptional)
Additional Notes:
The response demonstrates:

Strong mathematical competency
Practical deployment experience
Understanding of real-world constraints (spectrum, power, costs)
Vendor ecosystem knowledge
Strategic planning capabilities

The formatting with clear sections and mathematical notation enhances readability. The recommendation to combine 200 MHz + 8x8 MIMO for 7.384 Gbps (exceeding the 5.066 Gbps requirement) shows good engineering margin planning.
Recommendation: This response quality indicates strong suitability for capacity planning tasks and strategic network evolution decisions. The model would be valuable for network planning teams.
