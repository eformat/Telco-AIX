Question: 5G cell site with 100MHz bandwidth, 256 QAM modulation, 4x4 MIMO. Current average throughput is 1.2 Gbps with 65% PRB utilization. Predict capacity requirements for 40% YoY growth over 3 years.

Answer:
5G Cell Site Capacity Planning for 40% YoY Growth Over 3 Years
1. Current Network Parameters
Bandwidth: 100 MHz
Modulation: 256 QAM (8 bits/s/Hz)
MIMO: 4x4 (4 spatial streams)
Average Throughput: 1.2 Gbps
PRB Utilization: 65%
2. Current Peak Capacity Calculation
The peak capacity is derived from the average throughput and PRB utilization:

5. Capacity Upgrade Options
To meet 5.066 Gbps peak capacity, consider the following upgrades:

Parameter	Current	Upgrade Option	Impact on Capacity
Bandwidth	100 MHz	200 MHz (x2)	3.692 Gbps (peak)
Modulation	256 QAM	1024 QAM (x1.25)	2.307 Gbps (peak)
MIMO	4x4	8x8 (x2)	3.692 Gbps (peak)
Combined Upgrade	-	200 MHz + 8x8 MIMO	7.384 Gbps (peak)
6. Recommended Upgrade Path
Bandwidth Expansion: Increase to 200 MHz (if spectrum is available).
MIMO Enhancement: Upgrade to 8x8 MIMO for spatial multiplexing gains.
Modulation: Retain 256 QAM unless SNR allows 1024 QAM (requires better signal quality).
Resulting Peak Capacity:

7. Vendor-Specific Solutions
Ericsson: Cloud RAN with 200 MHz support and AirScale 8x8 MIMO.
Nokia: AirScale 8x8 MIMO and 200 MHz carrier aggregation.
Huawei: CloudRAN with 8T8R and 200 MHz bandwidth.
Mavenir: OpenBeam for flexible MIMO and bandwidth scaling.
8. Deployment Strategy
Phase 1 (Year 1): Expand bandwidth to 150 MHz and upgrade to 8x8 MIMO.
Phase 2 (Year 2): Further increase to 200 MHz and optimize 1024 QAM usage where feasible.
Phase 3 (Year 3): Add edge computing (MEC) to offload latency-sensitive traffic.
9. Cost Considerations
CAPEX: Antenna upgrades ($50k–$100k), spectrum licensing (varies by region).
OPEX: Increased power consumption (8x8 MIMO + 200 MHz ≈ 20% higher energy use).
10. KPI Targets
PRB Utilization: Maintain ≤65% to avoid congestion.
Throughput: Achieve ≥5.066 Gbps peak capacity by Year 3.
User Experience: Ensure 95th percentile throughput ≥2.5 Gbps.
11. Risk Mitigation
Spectrum Availability: Secure 200 MHz licenses in advance.
Interference Management: Use AI/ML-based RIC for dynamic beamforming.
Backhaul: Ensure 10 Gbps+ fronthaul capacity to support 8x8 MIMO.
Final Recommendation:
Upgrade to 200 MHz bandwidth + 8x8 MIMO to achieve 7.384 Gbps peak capacity, exceeding the 5.066 Gbps requirement. This approach balances cost, feasibility, and future-proofing for 5G-Advanced (Release 19) capabilities.
