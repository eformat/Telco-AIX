Question: Users report poor voice quality in VoLTE calls with MOS scores dropping to 2.5. RAN KPIs show: RSRP -95dBm, SINR 8dB, jitter 45ms, packet loss 0.5%. Identify root cause and remediation.

Root Cause Analysis & Remediation for Poor VoLTE Quality (MOS 2.5)

1. Root Cause Identification
Key KPIs & Implications
RSRP -95dBm: Acceptable coverage (≥-105dBm for VoLTE), but marginal for edge users.
SINR 8dB: Suboptimal (ideal ≥10dB for VoLTE). Indicates interference (co-channel/adjacent-channel) or congestion.
Jitter 45ms: Exceeds VoLTE threshold (≤30ms). Suggests transport layer issues (e.g., bufferbloat, QoS misconfigurations) or core network latency.
Packet Loss 0.5%: Within acceptable limits (≤1%), but combined with jitter, degrades MOS.
2. Detailed Root Cause Breakdown
A. Interference & SINR Degradation
Possible Causes:
Co-channel/adjacent-channel interference from neighboring cells (e.g., overlapping sectors, unoptimized power control).
External interference (e.g., illegal transmitters, radar, or microwave leakage).
High cell load (e.g., >70% resource utilization) causing intra-cell interference.
Impact: Low SINR forces lower MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme), increasing retransmissions and jitter.
B. Jitter in Transport/Core Network
Possible Causes:
Transport network congestion (e.g., backhaul between eNodeB and SGW/PGW).
QoS misconfiguration (e.g., incorrect QCI 1 prioritization for VoLTE).
IMS core/SBC bottlenecks (e.g., SBC buffer overflow, codec mismatch).
Timing issues (e.g., PTP synchronization drift in fronthaul/midhaul).
C. RAN Scheduling & QoS
Possible Causes:
Insufficient VoLTE bearer prioritization (e.g., QCI 1 not enforced).
Suboptimal scheduling weights for VoLTE traffic in the eNodeB.
Bearer aggregation (e.g., EPS Bearer misconfiguration) leading to resource contention.
3. Remediation Plan
A. Interference Mitigation
Drive Test & Interference Scan:
Use tools like Ericsson Spectrum Analyzer or Nokia NetAct to identify external/internal interference sources.
Check for PCI conflicts or overlapping sectors.
Power Control Optimization:
Adjust TX power and antenna tilt to reduce interference.
Enable Adaptive Power Control (APC) for dynamic interference management.
Cell Reconfiguration:
Reduce cell range via beamforming or Massive MIMO to minimize overlap.
Replan frequency reuse (e.g., 3-sector reuse to 1-sector reuse in dense areas).
B. Jitter Reduction
Transport Network QoS:
Ensure DSCP marking (e.g., EF for QCI 1) and DiffServ policies on backhaul links.
Implement traffic shaping and buffer management (e.g., WRED) to mitigate bufferbloat.
IMS Core/SBC Optimization:
Verify SBC configuration for jitter buffer size (e.g., 50ms adaptive buffer).
Check codec negotiation (e.g., prioritize AMR-WB over G.711 for better MOS).
Timing Synchronization:
Validate IEEE 1588 PTP accuracy (≤1μs drift) in fronthaul/midhaul.
Replace faulty GPS/Galileo modules if synchronization is off.
C. RAN & Core QoS Tuning
QCI 1 Prioritization:
Ensure QCI 1 bearers are configured with ARP 1 (highest priority) and GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate).
Validate PCC rules in PCF/SMF for VoLTE traffic.
Scheduling Optimization:
Increase VoLTE scheduling weights in eNodeB (e.g., set VoLTE Scheduler Weight to 80%).
Enable HARQ-ACK feedback to reduce retransmissions.
Load Balancing:
Offload traffic via SON (Self-Organizing Networks) or Dynamic Cell Optimization (DCO).
Deploy Small Cells in high-interference areas.
D. Additional Checks
Mobility Optimization:
Reduce ping-pong handovers by adjusting A3 event thresholds.
Enable SON X2 Self-Optimization for seamless handover.
Recent Changes:
Rollback recent RAN/core upgrades if issues started post-deployment.
Validate vendor interoperability (e.g., Ericsson eNodeB with Huawei 5GC).
4. Expected Outcomes
Metric	Target Post-Remediation
SINR	≥10dB
Jitter	≤30ms
MOS	≥3.5 (per ITU-T P.862)
Packet Loss	≤0.3%
5. Tools & References
3GPP Specifications: TS 22.222 (VoLTE QoS), TS 23.203 (QoS Framework).
Vendor Tools: Ericsson O1 (for RAN optimization), Nokia NetAct (for interference analysis).
Standards: ITU-T G.114 (End-to-End IP Network Delay).
6. Business Impact
Cost: $50k–$150k for drive tests, SBC upgrades, and SON licenses.
ROI: 20–30% reduction in churn, 15% improvement in customer satisfaction (CSAT).
Next Steps: Prioritize interference mitigation and QoS tuning, followed by transport network validation. Monitor KPIs post-remediation using Ericsson ENM or Nokia NetAct for 72 hours.
