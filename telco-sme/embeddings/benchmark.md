# Embedding Verification Test Cases

## Overview
Test cases for verifying embedding relevance ratios between base text and queries using Qwen3-Embedding-8B model with cosine similarity measurement.

## Test Configuration
- **Model**: Qwen3-Embedding-8B (Local Inference)
- **Hardware**: RTX 4090 48GB
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine Similarity
- **Processing**: Single embeddings (demo purposes)

## Relevance Categories

### High Relevance (Expected Cosine Similarity: 0.75-1.0)
Direct semantic matches, paraphrased content, exact topic alignment

### Medium Relevance (Expected Cosine Similarity: 0.4-0.8)
Related concepts, broader topic connections, contextual relationships

### Low Relevance (Expected Cosine Similarity: 0.0-0.4)
Unrelated content, different domains, misleading keyword matches

## Test Cases

### 1. HIGH RELEVANCE TESTS

#### Test Case H1: ML Definition Match
- **Category**: Direct Semantic Match

- **Expected Success**: 95%
- **Rationale**: Direct definitional match with key terms alignment

#### Test Case H2: Microservices Architecture
- **Category**: Technical Documentation
- **Base Text**: "Microservices architecture breaks down applications into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs. This approach improves scalability and maintainability."
- **Query**: "How do microservices improve application scalability?"
- **Expected Range**: 0.75-1.0
- **Expected Success**: 90%
- **Rationale**: Technical concept with specific benefit query

#### Test Case H3: Code Implementation
- **Category**: Code Match
- **Base Text**: 
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
- **Query**: "Python bubble sort implementation"
- **Expected Range**: 0.8-1.0
- **Expected Success**: 85%
- **Rationale**: Exact algorithm implementation match

### 2. MEDIUM RELEVANCE TESTS

#### Test Case M1: Related Cloud Concepts
- **Category**: Related Concepts
- **Base Text**: "Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, and databases over the internet. Major providers include AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud."
- **Query**: "What are the benefits of serverless computing?"
- **Expected Range**: 0.5-0.8
- **Expected Success**: 70%
- **Rationale**: Related cloud technologies, broader concept connection

#### Test Case M2: Development Methodologies
- **Category**: Related Methodology
- **Base Text**: "Agile methodology emphasizes iterative development, team collaboration, and responding to change. Common frameworks include Scrum and Kanban."
- **Query**: "How does DevOps relate to software development?"
- **Expected Range**: 0.4-0.7
- **Expected Success**: 65%
- **Rationale**: Both are software development methodologies but different focus areas

#### Test Case M3: Database Concepts
- **Category**: Database Concepts
- **Base Text**: "Database normalization reduces data redundancy by organizing data into related tables. The process involves applying normal forms like 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF."
- **Query**: "SQL query optimization techniques"
- **Expected Range**: 0.5-0.75
- **Expected Success**: 60%
- **Rationale**: Both database-related but different aspects (design vs performance)

### 3. LOW RELEVANCE TESTS

#### Test Case L1: Unrelated Domains
- **Category**: Unrelated Domains
- **Base Text**: "The solar system consists of eight planets orbiting the Sun. Earth is the third planet and the only known planet with life."
- **Query**: "How to implement OAuth authentication?"
- **Expected Range**: 0.0-0.4
- **Expected Success**: 90%
- **Rationale**: Astronomy vs authentication - completely different domains

#### Test Case L2: Biology vs Technology
- **Category**: Biology vs Technology
- **Base Text**: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen using chlorophyll."
- **Query**: "Best practices for containerizing applications"
- **Expected Range**: 0.0-0.3
- **Expected Success**: 95%
- **Rationale**: Biological process vs software deployment - no semantic connection

#### Test Case L3: Literature vs Programming
- **Category**: Literature vs Programming
- **Base Text**: "Shakespeare wrote many famous plays including Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and Macbeth during the Elizabethan era."
- **Query**: "React component lifecycle methods"
- **Expected Range**: 0.0-0.3
- **Expected Success**: 95%
- **Rationale**: Literature vs modern web development - different eras and domains

### 4. EDGE CASE TESTS

#### Test Case E1: Keyword Confusion
- **Category**: Keyword Confusion
- **Base Text**: "Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, and automation."
- **Query**: "Python snake species and habitat"
- **Expected Range**: 0.1-0.5
- **Expected Success**: 75%
- **Rationale**: Same keyword "Python" but completely different contexts - tests semantic understanding vs keyword matching

#### Test Case E2: Empty Content
- **Category**: Empty Content
- **Base Text**: ""
- **Query**: "What is artificial intelligence?"
- **Expected Range**: 0.0-0.3
- **Expected Success**: 85%
- **Rationale**: Empty base text should result in very low similarity regardless of query content
